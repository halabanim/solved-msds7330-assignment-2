<ul>

 <li>The Entity-Relationship model is

  <ol>

   <li>a way to graphically represent the logical relation-ships of entities in a database.</li>

   <li>a way to graphically represent the data in adatabase.</li>

   <li>a way to graphically represent only the constraintsin a database.</li>

   <li>a way to graphically represent strong entity setsbut not weak entity sets.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>In the Entity-Relationship model, to what does an <em>entity </em>refer (or represent)?

  <ol>

   <li>The organization in which the model is created.</li>

   <li>A distinctly identifiable item, thing or object.</li>

   <li>A particular instance of data.</li>

   <li>A database schema.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>An <em>entity set </em>is

  <ol>

   <li>a collection of databases.</li>

   <li>a collection of relationships connecting a singleentity to many other entities.</li>

   <li>a collection of entities of the same type that sharethe same properties.</li>

   <li>a collection of attribute values that are the sameacross all entities.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Entities can be associated with one another by using which of the following?

  <ol>

   <li>Entities</li>

   <li>Attributes</li>

   <li>Identifiers</li>

   <li>Relationships</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>In a one-to-many relationship, the entity that is on the many side of the relationship is called what type of entity?

  <ol>

   <li>parent</li>

   <li>child</li>

   <li>instance</li>

   <li>subtype</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>In an Entity-Relationship model, attributes may be which of the following?

  <ol>

   <li>simple</li>

   <li>composite</li>

   <li>multi-valued</li>

   <li>All of the above.</li>

   <li>None of the above.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>In an Entity-Relationship model, relationship sets are represented by which of the following?

  <ol>

   <li>Rectangles</li>

   <li>Diamonds</li>

   <li>Lines</li>

   <li>Ovals</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Directed lines from a relationship set to all of its related entity sets indicates which type of relationship?

  <ol>

   <li>One-to-one</li>

   <li>One-to-many</li>

   <li>Many-to-one</li>

  </ol></li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>Many-to-many</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Consider the entity set <em>instructor </em>containing the attributes <em>ID, name, deptName </em>and <em>salary </em>with <em>ID </em>as the primary key and the entity set <em>department </em>containing the attributes <em>deptName, building </em>and <em>budget </em>with <em>deptName </em>as the primary key. In order to represent the relationship between <em>instructor </em>and <em>department </em>we need to do which of the following?

  <ol>

   <li>The relationship is properly representedby the <em>deptName </em>attribute in the <em>instructor </em>entity set.</li>

   <li>Add a one-to-one relationship <em>instructorDepartment </em>that explicitly relates <em>instructor </em>to <em>department </em>and leave the entity sets unchanged.</li>

   <li>Add a one-to-one relationship <em>instructorDepartment </em>that explicitly relates <em>instructor </em>to <em>department </em>and remove the <em>deptName </em>attribute from the <em>instructor </em>entity set.</li>

   <li>Add a one-to-many relationship <em>instructorDepartment </em>that explicitly relates <em>instructor </em>to <em>department </em>and remove the <em>deptName </em>attribute from the <em>instructor </em>entity set.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Which of the following is NOT a basic element of the Chen version of the E-R model?

  <ol>

   <li>Entities</li>

   <li>Attributes</li>

   <li>Relationships</li>

   <li>All of the above.</li>

   <li>None of the above.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>An attribute that names or identifies entity instances is a(n):

  <ol>

   <li>entity</li>

   <li>attribute</li>

   <li>identifier</li>

   <li>relationship</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>In an Entity-Relationship model, double lines connecting</li>

</ul>

 <li>Every entity participates in up to two relationshipsof the given type.</li>

 <li>Some entities participate in more than one relation-ship of the given type.</li>

 <li>Every entity participates in at least one relationshipof the given type.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Relationship sets can be used to directly represent which of the following?

  <ol>

   <li>Entity attributes.</li>

   <li>Relationships between attribute values.</li>

   <li>Relationship between multiple entity sets.</li>

   <li>All of the above.</li>

   <li>None of the above.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>In the Entity-Relationship model, attributes may be represented as which of the following?
